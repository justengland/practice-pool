Physics Lessons
Angle of reflection:	The angle between the reflected ray and the normal.
Angle of refraction:    The angle between the refracted ray and the normal.
Angular momentum:	Also called moment of momentum, it is the cross product of position vector and momentum.
momentum in 2d:
Velocity: is a physical vector quantity; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it.
